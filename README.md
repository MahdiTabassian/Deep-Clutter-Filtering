### TODO list for preparing the codes
- creating a config file to rung the training and testing codes on command line
- modifying the id and tr-val-te data preparation function by remoing the for loops as much as possible
  - for this, we need to make sure that the images are organized in the sub-direcotries as considered in the above function
- renaming the variables that do not make sense and are not suitable
